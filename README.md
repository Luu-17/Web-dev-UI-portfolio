# Web-dev-UI-portfolio
# This is Assignent was created by a group of 5 members. We devided the coding coding to sections. Our man platform for group colaboration was discord because we could help each other in real-time if we got stuck and also get to see the codes running as we put the divided sections together. Upon reading the instruction we concluded that we should add javascript to assignment since it stated that we should apply all that we learnt in the previous classes.

I CREATED THE THIRD SECTION OF THE HMTL CODE AND ITS CSS . I MANAGED TO CREATE THE PAGES AND MADE THEM RESPONSIVE USING THE FLEXBOX.
ON THE FIRST SECTION WHICH IS THE LANDING SECTION, MY CONTRIBUTION WAS TO ADD THE SCRIPT THAT MAKES THE TEXT PRINT LETTER BY LETTER AND ALSO ADD THE FONT STYLE . I also added the dark mode script/feature  on the landing section.
