# This Assignment was created by a group of 5 members. We divided the sections, each person had a section/sections to code and then brought them together. Our main platform for group colaboration was discord because we could help each other in real-time if we got stuck and also get to see the codes running as we put the divided sections together. Upon reading the instruction we concluded that we should add javascript to assignment since it stated that we should apply all that we learnt in the previous classes.

# The names of the group member are:

# Thamsanqa Emmanuel Sanewe
# Katlego Dipheko

# THAMSANQA'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ASSIGNMENT
I CREATED THE THIRD SECTION OF THE HMTL CODE AND ITS CSS . I MANAGED TO CREATE THE PAGES AND MADE THEM RESPONSIVE USING THE FLEXBOX.
ON THE FIRST SECTION WHICH IS THE LANDING SECTION, MY CONTRIBUTION WAS TO ADD THE SCRIPT THAT MAKES THE TEXT PRINT LETTER BY LETTER AND ALSO ADD THE FONT STYLE . I also added the dark mode script/feature  on the landing section.

# KATLEGO'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE ASSIGNMENT 
 I was responsible for creating the second section of the website, which serves as the biography and contact profile. I built both the HTML structure and CSS styling for this section, ensuring a modern and clean layout. The design features a two-column card, one side displaying a profile image and the other presenting personal details such as name, location, email, phone number, and a short biography. I also included social media icons and styled buttons for hiring and CV download functionality.

 **Ntwenhle's Contribution**
 I was responsible for the fourth section in the project. My part was the "My Featured skills" section. I did the HTML and CSS code with the media in the section.
